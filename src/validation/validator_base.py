"""Reusable, agent-agnostic validation base.

Every agent output runs through :class:`ValidatorBase` before it is persisted as a
:class:`~src.validation.review_schema.GeneratedOutput`. Validation happens in two
steps and **never raises** on bad output — it returns a structured result instead
(graceful invalid-output handling):

1. **Schema check** — parse ``raw_output`` and validate it against the agent's
   declared Pydantic schema, collecting any errors.
2. **Guardrails** — only if the schema check passed, run each guardrail rule and
   collect violations.

The validator has no knowledge of any specific agent: the caller supplies the
schema type and (optionally) the rules, so the same base validates any agent
output. :func:`build_generated_output` then turns a validation result into the
``GeneratedOutput`` record to persist, copying the verdict onto the record.
