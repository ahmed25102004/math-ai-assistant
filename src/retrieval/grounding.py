"""The grounding contract: (query + scope) -> grounded context with provenance.

:func:`build_grounded_context` is the single entry point agents (or the
orchestration layer) call to obtain a :class:`GroundedContext` — the payload
that keeps answers grounded in uploaded content. :func:`verify_references`
is the QA-side complement: it checks that the references an agent *cited*
were actually part of the retrieved context, so fabricated citations are
caught before review/export.
