# Sprint 1 – Mentor & Concept Agents Foundation

This sprint introduces the foundation for two educational AI agents:

- **Mentor Agent**
- **Concept Explanation Agent**

The implementation provides:

- Typed Pydantic output schemas
- YAML-based prompt templates
- Configurable mock mode
- Live LLM provider support
- Shared Agent Registry
- JSON parsing and schema validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests for the main success and failure scenarios

---

## Project Components

### `src/agents/`

Contains the implementation of each educational agent.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mentor_agent.py` | Generates guided educational responses, highlights key learning points, and suggests next learning steps while avoiding giving complete solutions. |
| `concept_agent.py` | Produces structured concept explanations focused on understanding rather than mentoring. |

---

### `src/prompts/`

Contains external YAML prompt templates.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `mentor.yaml` | Prompt template for the Mentor Agent including role, instructions, grounding rules, and output contract. |
| `concept.yaml` | Prompt template for the Concept Explanation Agent with a structured explanation format and difficulty-aware instructions. |

Keeping prompts outside the Python code allows prompt updates without changing the implementation.

---

### Output Schemas

Each agent validates every generated response using a dedicated Pydantic schema.

- `MentorOutput`
- `ConceptOutput`

Validation guarantees that every response matches the expected JSON structure before being returned.

---

### Agent Registry

Implemented in:

```text
src/registry.py
```

Responsibilities:

- Register available agents
- Register the corresponding output schema for each agent
- Retrieve agents by name
- Retrieve schemas by agent name
- Reject unknown agent names with descriptive errors

---

## Mock Mode

Mock Mode allows development and testing without connecting to an external LLM provider.

Enable Mock Mode:

```env
MOCK_MODE=true
```

When enabled:

- No API requests are sent.
- Responses are generated locally.
- JSON parsing and Pydantic validation are still executed.
- The same validation pipeline used in production is preserved.

This is useful during development and while an LLM provider is unavailable.

---

## Live Provider Configuration

To use a real language model:

```env
MOCK_MODE=false
```

During Sprint 1 validation, the implementation was tested using:

**Provider**

```
OpenRouter
```

**Model**

```
nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free
```

The implementation is provider-independent and can later be switched back to LiteLLM or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint without changing the agent logic.

---

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

Example:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
DEFAULT_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free

MOCK_MODE=false
```

For local development without an LLM provider:

```env
MOCK_MODE=true
```

Never commit your API keys or secrets.

---

## Generation Pipeline

Both agents follow the same workflow:

```text
YAML Prompt
      │
      ▼
Prompt Construction
      │
      ▼
LLM Generation
(Mock or Live Provider)
      │
      ▼
JSON Parsing
      │
      ▼
Pydantic Validation
      │
      ▼
Typed Output
```

## Testing

This project uses **pytest** for automated testing.

Run all tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Or run individual test files:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_mentor_agent.py
python -m pytest tests/test_concept_agent.py
python -m pytest tests/test_registry.py
python -m pytest tests/test_schema_separation.py
python -m pytest tests/test_invalid_json.py
python -m pytest tests/test_invalid_yaml.py
python -m pytest tests/test_missing_yaml.py
python -m pytest tests/test_missing_env.py
```

To display the generated model responses during testing, run pytest with the `-s` flag:

```bash
python -m pytest -s tests/test_mentor_agent.py
python -m pytest -s tests/test_concept_agent.py
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:

- Successful Mentor Agent generation and `MentorOutput` schema validation
- Successful Concept Agent generation and `ConceptOutput` schema validation
- Agent Registry lookup and schema mapping
- Schema separation between Mentor and Concept outputs
- Invalid JSON response handling
- Invalid YAML syntax detection
- Missing YAML file handling
- Missing environment configuration handling
- Unknown agent name handling
- Mock-mode baseline generation and validation
